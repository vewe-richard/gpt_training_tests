# TO STUDY
* text_file_54.txt will generate an error                       (qq)     Done
* how to train a minimal model for questions and answers style  (qj/qq)
* Make clear on the relations                                   (qj)
  torch, torchvsion, train, ....
* Can we run a model to generate answer in GPU to improve performance? raspberry pi? (qj/qq)
* Difference between various models in huff* site               (qj/qq)
* dolly/gpt4all/standford
